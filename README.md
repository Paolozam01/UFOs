# UFOs

## Overview of the analysis:

The whole purpose of this task is to help Dana create a visualization for her database on UFO sightings. She is really interested on sharing this information with the world and I helped her create an HTML page in order to create a table in which people can filter the data to find intresting information. This task helped me develop my skills on HTML and Java while helping Dana create her database visualization. 

## Results:

As we can see on the image above, the HTML page is atractive and easy to understand for anyone interested on this information. On the left side we can see the filter options where you can be able to filter the data by date, city, state, country and shape. The filters entered will be displayed on the right side with all the information that matches the filters requested. 

## Summary: 

This visualizatio is greate for anyone interested on UFO sighting but ther is always room for improvment. I could spot two main drawbacks for this visualization which is that the information has te be updated manually and the filters are not very friendly. The user has to write the filter exactly as it is on the database which is not very user friendly. I would recommend the use of APIs in order to have the database to update automatically and also make the filter more userfriendly making it able to detect incorrect spelling and be less case sensitive.
